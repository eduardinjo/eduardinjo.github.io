# "Hi! My names Urrathon"

Well socializing is a big thing if you happen to be a homo sapiens and live in an area with larger population density than Siberia. I see people who are really proficient in it and are able to easily converse with new people in situations where you don't really know anyone but the group knows each other.
The upside is that you can meet new people and learn something new about subcultures or specific topics that usually are too trivial to be posted online. (But then reading a book would be more immersive and give better insight). Probably best use would be having a quick conversation where each one gets different perspective on their topic.
 Or doing something with that person that's characteristic of their subculure as there probably wont be alternatives to get that experience. For example,  to play [DnD][1] you need a gamemaster and other people so doing this alone is impossible.

## Starting conversation

But as always its usually harder then it looks or at least its how I feel. How do you start a conversation with someone you don't know? Simple "hi" is too awkward and doesn't really lead into anything. Movies represent some brash, funny lines and that might work as its clear for the other person what he can respond and this might lead to a conversation but no guarantee it will be about topic of interest for you. And it also requires some skill just to come up with appropriate line (or some general line might work?) and keep the conversation going with standard answers where none of the parties learns anything new.

Maybe starting conversation by asking about topic of interest straight away would be the best. It guarantees conversation about your topic and won't require any conversational skills beyond topics. Problem is you need to know the topic and know which person could likely know it. But these kinds of situations are really easy anyways. But sometimes you know nothing about subculture besides that it is one. So you cannot ask anything specific or there is no specific questions (Can you tell me about life of a biker in general? Kinda hard to answer compared to: How did you get involved in this particular group of bikers? Or what happens to lone wolf bikers? )

But sometimes you know only that you want to converse with a specific person but don't care what about. For example, a beautiful gal or lad. Before you start saying that's shallow and looks don't matter then I'll say its not 100% accurate statement. First of looks matter if you don't know anything about that person and such situations will occur quite often. I find that I have lot more interest to converse with a person if she looks good but in those cases I'm interested in play/flirt more and therefore it makes sense.

I guess its worth distinguishing between situations where you starting conversation signals flirt or similar interest or where starting to converse implies little. For example in debate club meeting talking with someone just feels more natural that actually not talking. Or in friends party meeting new people is almost mandatory if most people know each other in that group. In comparison this seems like a clearly superior method putting yourself in situations where default behavior is to meet new people and requires same conversational skills you have with your friends + some basics of meeting new people. But real catch is that those situations will usually serve another function such as debate club so even if you don't meet anyone its fine as you were there for different purpose. Downside is that not many new people are going to show up and are probably going to be similar which can be positive or negative depending on goals.

## Running summary

* Situations can be differentiated by how much people know each other in that population. The more closely knit group the easier to start conversation and less required skills but smaller turnover and diversity. Usually bonus to some activity not ends to a mean.
* Not knowing anyone means that starting a conversation will usually signal physical interest in that person and will require skills. Although not easy, doesn't have limitation which people you can meet.
* Those two are extremes one requires significant skills but the other has low new people turnover. Acquiring decent social skills should have good ROI if it their mastery fallows exponential law. Then you can get away with being among populations that have fewer social ties but higher turnover.

* The above should be somehow tested/supported.
