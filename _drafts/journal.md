* Starting journal because it might me the key habit to develop
 - if I write everyday what I do and what I learned this would add reflective loop which forces me to see what have I done during the week. Hence slacking would be visible and hopefully make me become more productive. It's like in book about habits: that you first write down what you did, speculate about likely causes and only then experiment with rewards to change bad habits. So this would be first step.


* Yesterday in tinder I saw my crush from 3 years ago and obviously because it didn't end well we didn't match. Sad but really just sunk cost fallacy because so many other options. Then I went on tilt because match didn't want to meet up on Friday and unmatched. Wrote to lots of matches and unmatched all of them cause two said they were busy and of course I was on tilt. Probably there were matches that would have agreed to see but I was not interested in them because of visuals - sad but true in tinder game.  

* I need a hobby because casually meeting people is fine for like an hour or less but usually not satisfying. Doing something you like with social experience as an extra would be much better.

* Otherwise empty wasted day - wake up late, watch LoL, and do little useful. Plus hands are getting tired.
