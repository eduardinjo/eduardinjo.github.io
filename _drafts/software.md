# Using Software

Must again agree with **gwern** who states that keeping your used software count to a minimum (and basically anything else too) is a good idea. It takes resources to manage each additional software, time to learn ropes and become effective at it (learn shortcuts, how to do certain stuff best, what exactly is possible with it).
>Perfection is not when you have nothing to add, but when you have nothing to remove.

So for every software you add you should consider removing something else. Below will be my current software list with explanations for using them.

* OS - Ubuntu 14.04 /Windows
  - switching to ubuntu is much better option as it's easier to use and open-source
* Text editor - *Atom*
  - Good looking and easy to start with. Because it's recently made it might be lacking some features hence should revisit it's quality in about a year.
* Blog rendered - jekyll
* Browser - Mozzilla / Chrome
  - might go over to Mozilla because don't wanna put all eggs in Google's basket.
* 3D CAD - Solidworks - because I'm used to it in school and work


* Python - for programming
* Jupyter notebook - for IPython notebooks. Seems like interesting concept of publishing paper, code and data in an interactive mode so others can play with it and test your results.
* TensorFlow - machine learning software. Haven't tried out yet.

## Potentially interesting software

* Hakyll - haskell based blog renderer but requires more haskell knowledge
* Time management apps - something like timeful now acquired by google (suggests times for activities). Best to schedule time for activities in calendar
* Zotero - for managing scientific papers/artictles/books or just general references. Haven't used yet. 
* Authorea - can write collaborative papers and include IPython notebooks. Not self-hosted and unknown if can be integrated into blog
