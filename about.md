This site draws inspiration from [Long content by gwern][1] with key point being that best works are those that come from continuous effort.
For this you need a system which you will be able to use and maintain for many years hence a blog written in [human-readable language][2] using simple open-source software with large user base and as few dependencies as possible.

This blog serves multiple purposes:

1. To help me efficiently manage information
2. Provide high quality info about certain topics
3. Bring accountability to increase productivity

As *gwern* states it is terrible investment to write a post that will be read at best once. From readers perspective its also bad [ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment) because article probably will convey little information relative to time spent and by the law of large numbers there should be many great articles one hasn't read yet.

About article quality: we can say that any text is written in some code and we gain information from it depending on how well we can parse this code and analyze it with our current knowledge. For example, I have something that I want to convey and my proficiency in *english code* will determine how well I manage to do it. Of course how well others comprehend my meaning depends also on their ability to understand *english*. Writing with many specific terms will be better for someone who is well versed in them as it ads concision but its worse for uninitiated. So knowing your audience should help determine how to write your code. Should mention what is optimization function: maximum information per time unit. Information counts only if one can recall it afterwards, was generated (idea) during/after reading process.
A lot of articles would be written quickly and most likely have bad structure and wording and little average information per word (just like this article or should I say essay?).
In essence, you don't want your readers spend time reading garbage so you polish your article until it has a lot of substance and enough structure and links to other topics so its well remembered.

But what does it really mean? I want to write articles that really add some new information about that topic and be able to say that I really **know** something and therefore can give advice with good conscience.
