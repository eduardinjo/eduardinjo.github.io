## Why

This site draws inspiration from [Long content by gwern][1] with key point being that best works are those that come from continuous effort and will be relevant for many years to come. As *gwern* states it is terrible investment to write a post that will be read at best once. From readers perspective its also bad [ROI][3] because article probably will convey little information relative to time spent and by the law of large numbers there should be many better things one hasn't read or done yet.
