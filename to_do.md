title: Ideas for future site content and functionality
---

## Functionality
* Make clickable footnotes similar to [gwern.net](http://www.gwern.net/)
* Add Table of Contents for pages
* Complete site navigation menu and header
* Decide on color-scheme: currently white text on dark background seems easier on eyes
but could be worse for focus (and I see some bluriness)
* Site name: currently Urrathon but I feel affiliation with Rimmbell more just because Ive used it longer
